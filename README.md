---------------------------
No design , no layout....

Questions
1 - I opted for the area of frontend because I like to see things happen. 
I also like the part of the logic of data,
 but currently I am fasninado in learning frameworks and modern technologies


2 - - node is not an http server if you are looking for an http server. Modules is facily to use...
In other languagues for examples Jquery is necessary developer some code and adpate the core code.
